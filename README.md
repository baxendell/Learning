# Learning
Portfolio of items I am learning to further my skills as a developer.

### What is in this repository? ###
    
     JS
* NODE.js:
   * Weather app: created a weather app using wunderground api.  You can find weather via zipcode or location(New York, NY).  Wunderground API does have some errors for some zipcodes and is not due to the node code.
   * Webscraper: Built a webscraper that could benefit the current company I work for. It scraps google's search in regards to what query you are searching for and displays the amount of words used in the scrape.
